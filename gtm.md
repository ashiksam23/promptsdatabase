## 🧩 Step 3. Hybrid “Consultant-Grade GTM Prompt”

Here’s your **final, plug-and-play Go-To-Market Prompt** (you can paste this into ChatGPT/Gemini/etc. after your market sizing analysis).

---

### 🚀 **Consultant-Level Go-To-Market Strategy Prompt**

You are a **management consultant** building a **Go-To-Market (GTM) strategy** for a client entering or expanding in:
**[INSERT INDUSTRY / REGION / YEAR RANGE]**

### 🧠 Frameworks to Apply

Integrate these frameworks cohesively:

1. **3C Framework** – Analyze Company strengths, Customer needs, and Competitor landscape to anchor strategy.
2. **STP Framework** – Segment target audiences (MECE logic), identify high-value segments, and craft positioning for each.
3. **Ansoff Matrix** – Clarify whether the strategy is Market Penetration, Market Development, Product Development, or Diversification.
4. **AIDA Funnel** – Structure the customer journey (Awareness → Interest → Desire → Action) with matching channels.
5. **Channel-ROI Matrix** – Rank acquisition & distribution channels by cost-effectiveness and expected ROI.
6. **Flywheel Model + North Star Metric** – Define retention and referral loops; specify a single success metric (e.g., repeat rate, CAC:LTV, NPS).

## 🧭 Step 4. Tracking for Channel-Wise Success

After generating the GTM plan, you can feed the output into a **tracking sheet or dashboard** structured like this:

| Channel          | Funnel Stage | KPI             | Target  | Actual  | ROI   | Status |
| ---------------- | ------------ | --------------- | ------- | ------- | ----- | ------ |
| Paid Social      | Awareness    | Reach           | 100,000 | 120,000 | 1.2x  | ✅      |
