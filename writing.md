"I'm writing [email/presentation/post] about [topic]. Here's my current draft [Paste your draft]

Apply Wes Kao's 'start right before you get eaten by the bear' framework:
1. Identify where the actual 'bear moment' is (the moment of highest stakes/tension/value)
2. Rewrite the opening to start RIGHT THERE
3. Show me what backstory can be cut vs. what needs to be added later for context
4. Give me 3 different 'bear moment' options to test"
